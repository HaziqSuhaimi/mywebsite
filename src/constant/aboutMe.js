            <b>Yeap</b>. I don't have any background in <b>Computer Science</b> but i do have a Bachelor Deg. in <b>Mechanical Engineering</b> with minored in Robotics and Automation.<br/>
            <i>Okay... but why the jump?</i> &nbsp; -you might ask.<br />
            Don't get me wrong, I still passionate about robotics, iot, hardwares and those stuff <b>but</b> for the past <b>4 years</b> i actually realized that those fields still require
            software development knowledge and skills. Especially when it comes to the integration part.

            So, since then, i have decided to just dive-in into the world of software development.<br/>
            I resigned from my Robotic Eng. position and began picking up server side programming. How to spawn servers and brokers so client/devices can communicate remotely.
            I have done this so many time on hardware side but never knew how those actually work - why i got the data the way i needed to on hardware.

            My first programming language is python (yup clich√©, i know), since i have been using python for hardware development as well. But now, i think i know javascript more.<br/>
            From backend, frontend and even hybrid mobile app. I have been picking up those skills for the past 4 almost 5 years.

            Where do i learn all of these? YouTube mostly. It's free and tons of other developers have been sharing their thoughts and experiences. Having a small group of developers also helped me grow. 
            It is nice to have people around that are willing to help and discuss about certain problem.<br/>
            Owh yea! <b>Hackathons</b>! I love spending 24 hours straight coding and developing a prototype. Mainly not to win, but more like to test my limit. It's kinda rewarding when at the end of the day, you actually
            have something to show after those headache and hardwork.
